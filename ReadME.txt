# SimulatorForRadioControlledCars

-General Info:
This Project is about creating a simulator for radio-controlled cars which to be used to test cars. The simulator is a console application which will test various commands and see if the radio-controlled cars can execute them without hitting the wall.
The simulated environment would be a room and the size of it shall be what the user would request in meters.
The simulator will output the results of the simulation which either can be successful or unsuccessful. If the simulation was successful, it would print the end position and heading of the car and if itâ€™s not successful it would print an error describing, what went wrong and which position did it crash.
